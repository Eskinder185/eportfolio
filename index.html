        <h2>👾 Welcome to My Tech Universe</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Eskinder — part cloud engineer, part security geek, part AI explorer. 
          </p>
          <p>
              I design <b>secure AWS pipelines</b>, hack on <b>generative AI</b>, 
              and love turning bold ideas into working code. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Think of this portfolio as my <b>player’s hub</b> — choose a project below 
               and hit “start.” 🎮

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
  I’m a passionate technologist with a strong focus on <b>cloud computing</b>,
  <b>security</b>, and more recently <b>AI</b>. Over the past few years, I’ve
  built and deployed AWS solutions that don’t just scale but also stay secure
  and cost-effective. I enjoy designing systems that balance performance with
  protection, making sure applications are reliable and safe for users.
</p>
<p>
  Security isn’t just a feature to me—it’s part of the way I think about
  technology. From enforcing least-privilege IAM roles to automating monitoring
  and alerts, I like solving problems where cloud innovation meets smart
  security practices. My goal is to help teams move quickly without cutting
  corners on safety.
</p>
<p>
  I’m also diving deeper into the world of <b>AI</b>, especially
  <b>generative and agent AI</b>. I’ve been experimenting with OpenAI prompts
  and tools, exploring how these technologies can be combined with cloud and
  security to create smarter, more adaptive systems. I believe the future of
  cloud isn’t just scalable—it’s intelligent and secure.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of projects, I’m always exploring new tools and ideas—whether it’s
  testing emerging AWS services, reading about the latest in cybersecurity,
  or experimenting with AI agents. I enjoy sharing what I learn and connecting
  with others who are excited about building safer, more intelligent, and
  innovative systems in the cloud.
